```bash
npm start
```

2. **Start the frontend development server** (in another terminal):
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5174` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## üì± Mobile Access

### Option 1: Local Network (Same WiFi)
```bash
# Find your computer's IP address
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: The app accepts voice or text input describing your task
2. **Smart Parsing**: Uses regex patterns and natural language processing to extract:
   - Task title
   - Date/time information
   - Whether it's a calendar event or just a task
3. **Calendar Creation**: For time-sensitive items, creates Google Calendar events
4. **Trello Sync**: Creates cards in your Kings board with appropriate details
5. **Confirmation**: Shows success status and links to created items

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/create-task`: Creates calendar events and Trello cards
- `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint

## Configuration Notes

- Calendar email is set to: `vincent2king8@gmail.com`
- Trello cards are added to the Kings board list specified in your environment
- Time zone is set to America/New_York (adjust in server.js if needed)
- Default event duration is 1 hour for calendar events

## Troubleshooting

1. **Voice recognition not working**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome/Safari)
2. **Calendar events not creating**: Check your Google API credentials and refresh token
3. **Trello cards not creating**: Verify your API key, token, and list ID
4. **CORS issues**: Make sure both servers are running on the correct ports
5. **AI not working**: Check your OpenAI API key and billing status. The app falls back to basic parsing if AI fails
