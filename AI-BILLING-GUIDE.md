```
"Move my dentist appointment to a time that doesn't conflict with my meetings"
```
- **Claude**: Understands context, checks conflicts intelligently
- **OpenAI**: May miss nuanced scheduling logic
- **Value**: Worth 13x cost for complex operations

**‚úÖ Ambiguous Commands**
```
"Cancel anything related to grocery shopping this week"
```
- **Claude**: Better semantic matching and reasoning
- **OpenAI**: Might miss related events
- **Value**: Prevents scheduling mistakes

**‚úÖ Natural Conversation**
```
"What's the best time for a 2-hour meeting with travel time?"
```
- **Claude**: More thoughtful, conversational responses
- **OpenAI**: More mechanical responses
- **Value**: Better user experience

### When OpenAI is Sufficient

**‚úÖ Simple Task Creation**
```
"Dentist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM"
```
- **Both**: Handle equally well
- **OpenAI**: 13x cheaper with same result
- **Value**: No need for premium AI

**‚úÖ Direct Commands**
```
"Add grocery shopping to my calendar Friday at 10 AM"
```
- **Both**: Clear, unambiguous parsing
- **OpenAI**: Perfect for straightforward requests
- **Value**: Cost savings with no quality loss

## üí° Hybrid Strategy: Best of Both Worlds

### Smart Routing Algorithm
```javascript
if (command.type === "COMPLEX_EDIT" || command.type === "DELETE") {
    // Use Claude for reasoning-heavy tasks
    return await processWithClaude(input)
} else if (command.type === "SIMPLE_CREATE") {
    // Use OpenAI for straightforward tasks
    return await processWithOpenAI(input)
}
```

### Hybrid Cost Savings
**Assumption**: 70% simple tasks, 30% complex tasks

**Monthly costs for 25 tasks/day:**
- **Claude Only**: $3.38/month
- **OpenAI Only**: $0.15/month  
- **Hybrid Strategy**: $1.02/month (70% savings vs Claude-only)
